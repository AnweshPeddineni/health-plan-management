The Health Plan API is a RESTful API that provides CRUD operations for managing health plan-related JSON objects. It supports validation against a JSON schema, advanced semantics for operations, and data storage in a key/value store. The API is built using Spring Boot and utilizes Redis as the underlying database.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot: A Java framework for building robust and scalable applications.
- Redis: An in-memory data store used for storing health plan data.
- JSON Schema: A specification for defining the structure, data types, and validation rules for JSON objects.
- Postman: A popular tool for testing and interacting with APIs.

## Requirements

To run the Health Plan API locally, you need to have the following software installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Redis Server
